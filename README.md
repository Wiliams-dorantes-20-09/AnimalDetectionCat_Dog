# Animal Detection Using Neural Networks

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting and classifying two types of animals: **dogs** and **cats**. The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** and is trained with an augmented dataset to improve accuracy.

## Features  
- Uses a **deep learning model** to classify images of animals.  
- Implements **data augmentation** techniques to improve generalization.  
- Trains with **optimized parameters** for enhanced accuracy.  
- Includes **graphical visualization** of training progress.  
- Saves the trained model for future use.

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Main programming language)  
- **TensorFlow & Keras** (Deep learning frameworks)  
- **Matplotlib** (For visualizing model performance)  
- **ImageDataGenerator** (For data augmentation)

## Model Architecture  
The neural network consists of:  
1. **Input Layer**: Rescales image pixels.  
2. **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts features using multiple filters.  
3. **MaxPooling Layers**: Reduces dimensionality.  
4. **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.  
5. **Dropout Layer**: Prevents overfitting.  
6. **Softmax Activation**: Outputs probability distribution for classification.

## Dataset  
The dataset is structured into the following directories:  
- `my_cat_dog/train/` (Training data for cats and dogs)  
- `my_cat_dog/test/` (Test data for cats and dogs)  
- `my_cat_dog/validation/` (Validation data for model evaluation)  

Each of these directories contains subfolders for **cat** and **dog** images.

## Training Process  
1. Load and preprocess images.  
2. Train the model using augmented data.  
3. Validate model performance with unseen images.  
4. Plot accuracy and loss graphs.  
5. Save the final trained model.

## Results & Next Steps  
The model is trained to achieve high accuracy in classifying dogs and cats. Future improvements may include:  
- Increasing dataset size.  
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters.  
- Implementing more advanced CNN architectures.

## Usage  
- Run the Python script to train the model.  
- Load and use the saved model for inference on new images.

This project provides a foundational implementation for **image classification using deep learning** and can be extended for broader applications.
